To log in, use the email address {{ application.user.email }} and the password
you provided in the application.  You can reset your password by clicking the
"Forgot password?" link on the login page

Since the OpenCraft Instance Manager is in beta state, there might still be some
problems or downtime for your instance.  We appreciate any feedback on the
project â€“ just reply to this email!

Happy testing,
    the OpenCraft team
